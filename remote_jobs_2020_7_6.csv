By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity&rsquo;s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you&rsquo;d like to be a part of.

We are a socially conscious, distributed team. We give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living where you&rsquo;re most comfortable and working in areas where you can help foster and grow the community that you are a part of.

We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth. As part of early engineering at Crisp, you will have the unique opportunity to take products from concept to production as we build towards our goal of becoming the global technology platform for the food industry. You&rsquo;ll leverage your experience working with cloud native applications to ingest, transform, and expose industry data to help revolutionize how the food supply chain works.

Signs of a great candidate


* Collaborative.&nbsp;You know that your colleagues&rsquo; perspectives will make our customers successful. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together. You propose ways for us to be more engaged and successful with our customers.

* Customer focused. Our customers are at the forefront of your day. You prioritize our customers&rsquo; voice to ensure their needs are met.

* Ambitious, curious, and resourceful.&nbsp;You are innately curious, and you aren&rsquo;t afraid to work hard. You are self driven, you take direction well but are able to be creative to find results on your own when asked. You are driven to succeed because your hard work and results make you proud.

* Disciplined and reliable.&nbsp;We are a distributed company and you enjoy the benefits of working distributed while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.

* Appreciative of honest feedback.&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.

* Work smarter and harder.&nbsp;&nbsp;You often identify a problem, create a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful.

* Fluency in Norwegian Language.&nbsp;You will be fluent in Norwegian&nbsp;to assist our customer base.




Crisp&rsquo;s Backend Tech Stack


* Statically typed, modern languages.&nbsp;We use Kotlin and TypeScript.&nbsp; Knowledge of these specific technologies is not a requirement. If you&rsquo;re willing to learn, we&rsquo;re willing to help you along the way.

* Continuous deployment.&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it&rsquo;s not in production, it&rsquo;s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.

* JVM based back-end.&nbsp;The JVM has a robust, rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that we&rsquo;re leveraging to help us focus on building solutions, not tool-chains.

* Cloud first.&nbsp;As a services offering in the 21st century, the cloud isn&rsquo;t the future, it&rsquo;s the present. We&rsquo;re fully invested in using the features offered by our cloud provider in order to minimize technical debt and maximize productivity.

* Micro-services.&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we&rsquo;re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.

* Start-up mode.&nbsp; The team is still small, and the product is fresh.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be able to exert a large amount of influence, and contribute to decisions that will determine the future of the product and the team.




We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific background, experience or geographical location. Instead we&rsquo;re looking for individuals that are capable, reliable, and hoping to grow along with us. Do you have strengths you can share? If so, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you!

Scalable Path is looking for a Frontend React and HTML5 Developer with Canvas/SVG experience to join the team and work on a client project. This is a remote, part-time position&nbsp;(approximately 4 hours/day).

CLIENT COMPANY DESCRIPTION:
The client runs a podcast production web app that helps anyone to create their own podcast in the easiest way possible.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
You will be creating an Audio Player and Editor Tool for use in a Podcast Creation Web App as the first primary task.

The aim of this project is to build an audio player and editor, in the browser, which will allow users to import audio, edit out mistakes, split their clips and layer music, and voice in a multitrack interface.

The client has a limited version of this functionality currently operating in their existing web app built on React and Node. They use the [Wavesurfer plugin](https://wavesurfer-js.org/) to play audio and to offer an audio editing interface.

It's good at a basic level, but there are a number of limitations which they're struggling with, detailed in this spec, so they'd like to either (a) build their own browser-based audio player tool to replace it, and improve upon it, or (b) fork the current wavesurfer version and build their own custom version to overcome the limitations. Wavesurfer is built in HTML5 Canvas, and it seems to be the best solution for this type of work, but the client is open to other ideas.

The stages of this project are as follows:

V1 - Build their own player/editor, or an improved/forked wavesurfer, which replicates the functionality we already offer, right now.

V2 - Expand what they can do with edit regions on the current single-track version of wavesurfer.

V3 - Change how they do editing/production by building a multitrack version, which allows for 2 layered tracks and editing on both.

RELATIONSHIPS - WHO YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH:
Working with the CEO on the overall approach, reporting to their Lead Engineer, and working with 3 other developers. The client is in the Europe/London (+01:00) BST time zone.

REQUIRED SKILLS:
- React
- HTML5 Canvas (or another web visualization framework live SVG)
- CSS
- Excellent written and spoken English
- GIt

DESIRED (NICE-TO-HAVE) SKILLS:
- Node.js
- Wavesurfer.js (or another audio player/editor library)

START DATE:
As soon as possible.

Scalable Path is looking for a Full-stack Node &amp; React Developer for Chrome Extension to join the team and work on a client project. This is a remote, full-time position.

CLIENT COMPANY DESCRIPTION:
The client's application is a no-code productivity tool for individuals at work. They believe that working professionals should be able to concentrate on their actual work, not tedious and repetitive tasks that come along with it. That&rsquo;s why they designed a product that takes data that is siloed across different online services and makes it work TOGETHER so that it can trigger relevant automation at the right time and in real-time. They think that taking out the tediousness of day to day tasks shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult nor should it be left to the executive and virtual assistants &ndash; and that&rsquo;s exactly&nbsp;how we empower their users to do it on their own!

Their current product goal is to be the ""go-to productivity Chrome extension"" by handling a user's scheduling, tasks, and outreach needs better than an executive assistant. They are VC-funded and are in an exciting space (no-code automation!) with a great vision and a lot of features planned in their product roadmap over the next year!

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
You will be adding new features to an existing application based around a Chrome extension. You'll need to write code on both the server-side (Node) &amp; client-side (React) and follow existing coding style conventions.

Here are some of the project you might work on:
(1) Implementing a backend for the Chrome extension and setting up a third party DB and integrating with the chrome extension so local storage is no longer used
(2) Using the backend, create a personalized webpage for logged in users and implement a scheduling page (similar to Calendly). Mockups will be provided. Transfer/integrate with an existing website on Squarespace.
(3) Create a mobile Gmail/GSuite add-on for the chrome extension (https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview)
Possible Future Features:
(4) Text expander and email templates automation (based off the open source https://github.com/carlinyuen/ChromeAutoTextExpander )
(5) Intelligent task scheduling &amp; tracking. users enter tasks and have them intelligently scheduled into an existing calendar

RELATIONSHIPS - WHO YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH:
You'll be working with the founder (who is also a developer) who is based in New York and&nbsp;2&nbsp;developers. The client is in the America/New York (-04:00) EDT time zone.

REQUIRED SKILLS:
- Strong written and spoken English

- HTML/CSS
- Comfortable integrating 3rd party APIs
- Jest and Enzyme (for automated tests)
- MongoDB
- Ability to work within an existing design system and create new functionality with good user experience (sometimes without detailed designs for everything)

About Ceros

Ceros is an experiential platform that empowers the creation of bespoke, immersive digital experiences without code. We&rsquo;re passionate about helping companies transform their static digital content into engaging experiences. From custom microsites to immersive interactive webpages, you can build it with Ceros. Publish and update live content and instantly embed it into your site or social media platforms such as Pinterest or Snapchat. Join us and be part of the movement to enable everyone to create experiences that matter.

Our customers include some of the world&rsquo;s leading brands, such as Mashable, Bloomberg, Red Bull, United Airlines, and AIG.

We are well-funded and venture-backed by prominent investors including Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.

The Role

Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what&rsquo;s currently possible.

Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.&nbsp;We&rsquo;re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Docker, Jenkins, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.

As part of the Ceros product team, you&rsquo;ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you&rsquo;ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.

We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren&rsquo;t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it&rsquo;s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO&rsquo;s atrocious spelling.

Key Responsibilities


* writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying)

* having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write

* planning and leading high-complexity stories and epics

* reviewing story docs and offering insights on impacts to other parts of the application

* performing code reviews and helping to enforce our code and architectural standards

* participating as a primary on-call resource for service disruptions

* handling superfriend responsibilities with minimal assistance

* acting as release owner

Art+Logic is looking for Full Stack Web Developers to work with us on interesting custom software projects. We&rsquo;ve been around since 1991, and we&rsquo;re still going strong.&nbsp;

Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.

Since we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so.

We work remotely all over the United States and Canada. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won&rsquo;t have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other.

Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.

Here&rsquo;s an example of some projects we&rsquo;ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:


* Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login

* Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)

* Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display




What we want from you: (aka: skills)

We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience.&nbsp;

However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.

Relationship Details:

We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.

We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don&rsquo;t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week.&nbsp;

It&rsquo;s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren&rsquo;t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project.&nbsp;

 Essentials 

Location: Australia, fully remote work 
Employment type: Permanent full-time or part-time 
Salary: $100k - $130k + super 
Experience: min 3 years 

 Who we're looking for 
Managed Functions is looking for a well-grounded python developer that aspires to become a servant leader in the coming years and move into a CTO role. This role will be responsible for all front and back end development, DevOps, and infrastructure.

 This person will know how to create a learning environment as they will be working closely with a junior developer and teaching them the ropes. We believe most skills can be learned, but empathy, innate desire to help, and curiosity are things we can't teach you so these are must have qualities you'll possess. The key to delivering well for this role is to understand how to achieve the needs of our customers whilst keeping within the constraints of the Managed Functions DNA.

 As a developer, you are comfortable with failing and learning from and sharing those failures. There will be times we get things wrong at Managed Functions so you'll need to have the ability to reflect and discuss what happened and what we can do instead. Great communication skills are a must.

 This is not a data analyst/scientist role. In building data transformation pipelines for our customers, we often use ML components but, if available, we prefer to use an API than to build the ML model ourselves. But if you have experience as a data analyst/scientist and want to expand your wings into development and leadership roles, this could be a fit.

 We're committed to building a culturally diverse team and strongly encourage you to apply regardless of your location, background, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability or any other personally defining attribute.

 We encourage every person who is interested to apply. We&rsquo;re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn&rsquo;t apply. Take the leap - you never know, you might just be the perfect person for one of our open roles, even if you don&rsquo;t think you match 100% of the job description.

 Skills &amp; Experience (Required):


* Minimum of three years using Python professionally

* Experience using pandas

* AWS Lambda Functions

* AWS SAM

* Empathy for your users




 Bonus points:


* Love for Jupyter Notebooks

* Experience using javascript on the front-end

* DevOps experience




 Benefits


* Flexible working environment

* Become second in command

* Get across and use the most cutting-edge cloud technology as it is released

* Space to grow from senior through to CTO




 About Managed Functions 
Managed Functions is a profitable company looking to grow our development team as the sales pipeline is full.

 What do we do?
 Managed Functions are serverless data transformation pipelines that we deploy and manage for our customers. For example, several customers use our remittance processing pipeline which picks up PDF remittances from an email system, matches the remittance lines to open invoices in our customer&rsquo;s underwriting system and then pushes the payment record to their ERP system. We currently deploy our serverless pipelines on AWS but deploying to MS Azure and GCP is on the roadmap.

 Using Managed Functions, our customers are able to focus on their objectives and leave the transactional work to us. We count insurance companies and food service suppliers amongst our customers. Our customers are very happy with our work so far and delighted to have us managing their transactions every day. We want to continue to enchant them.

 Why are they so happy? 
Insurance companies can focus on pricing premiums rather than keying requests for premium quotes into their systems. Food service suppliers can focus on preparing and shipping high quality products to their hotel customers rather than manually entering purchase orders into the ordering systems. We help these companies save money (by not having to use expensive alternatives) and time by automating their processes, leaving them to focus on their most important work: serving their customers. 
 How to Apply 
We Are Common by Common Code are assisting Managed Functions with building their tech team. Please email your CV &amp; cover letter on why you'd like to fill the role to Val at work@commoncode.io.

You are a Frontend Developer in our SaaS Practice, focusing on building our BigCommerce and Shopify stores. You work with your team to deliver your projects on-time and on-budget, working closely with your customers and the wider business.

Here&rsquo;s how your week may look:

You start your day in a team Stand Up discussing progress you made yesterday, listening to your team members describe their current issues and dropping some knowledge bombs on how you &ldquo;solved this last time&rdquo;. You&rsquo;re working from home today, so you pay the pet tax and encourage your four-legged-friend wave to the camera before logging off.

First up you&rsquo;ve got a pair-programming session with a Junior Developer in your team to help them through a tough UI problem that they&rsquo;ve been working on. They&rsquo;ve been steadily improving under your experienced wing and are turning into a really productive team member.

After lunch you&rsquo;ll set your Slack status and turn on Do Not Disturb for a couple of hours while you debug a weird issue with a customer&rsquo;s site. Shopify recently released an update to the checkout and (for some reason!) your customer&rsquo;s site stopped working. You find the problem, update the functional tests to cover this use case and let the Project Manager know the good news! You push your feature branch to Bitbucket and watch Bitbucket Pipelines build your artifact and prove that your tests pass.

Your JIRA issue has automatically transitioned to &ldquo;In Code Review&rdquo; and you open your pull request, studying your diff carefully before assigning it to your team mate for a sanity check.

Tomorrow (assuming all is well!) you&rsquo;ll merge your pull request into a release branch and let Pipelines deploy it to Staging where it will be regression tested by the QA Team and their bank of automated tests. It should be out to Production by the end of the week, providing we can get through the testing and get client sign off by 2pm on Thursday.

You default to helping. If you find a bug in an library you're using and don't just find a workaround, but fix it and submit a PR to the repo, we want to hire you.

Nice things about working here

Apply your .NET skills as a&nbsp;developer&nbsp;within a&nbsp;multi-disciplinary A-team of experts. Day to day, you'll be collaboratively solving problems, architecting solutions, and&nbsp;expanding your&nbsp;mastery of CMS web development. If you are a tenacious problem-solver who thrives when digging&nbsp;deep into&nbsp;code and complex data sets, you will fit right in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We specialize in the design and development of&nbsp;enterprise&nbsp;.NET&nbsp;websites, so experience&nbsp;working with a.NET content management system (Ektron,&nbsp;Episerver, Umbraco, Sitecore, etc.) is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;

STRATEGY, DESIGN, AND&nbsp;DEVELOPMENT AS A TEAM SPORT.

When you become a .NET developer at&nbsp;Diagram, you'll get assigned to an account team with a strategist at the helm.

Each account team operates autonomously,&nbsp;meaning that&nbsp;the strategies your team propose will drive the&nbsp;work you do&mdash;what you can accomplish is limited only by your collective&nbsp;ideas and&nbsp;abilities.&nbsp;

* Using Git and version control

* Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and other JavaScript frameworks

If you work best when you're handed a blueprint and left alone to build in solitude for weeks on end, you might not be a good fit.&nbsp;Diagram&nbsp;developers prefer to be in the mix of things and would rather contribute to solving real problems with code than to just take orders. You are naturally curious, eager to learn,&nbsp;and play nice with others. As a developer at&nbsp;Diagram, you are treated as a professional, working with other professionals for common goals.Day to day,&nbsp;some of your responsibilities&nbsp;will include:


* Work with modern hosting&nbsp;technologies:&nbsp;Azure DevOps,&nbsp;CI/CD, AWS,&nbsp;Episerver&nbsp;DXC, Umbraco Cloud

* Analyze, troubleshoot, and resolve&nbsp;issues&nbsp;on enterprise client websites

* Adapt to and learn new&nbsp;and emerging .NET/CMS&nbsp;technologies

* Communicate and convey technical concepts to clients, team members, and project managers

* Contribute to functional requirements and technical documentation

* Work both independently as well as collaboratively within a team

* Propose and architect&nbsp;technical&nbsp;solutions that&nbsp;help&nbsp;drive our clients forward

* Estimate effort for development tasks

No more hand-offs. Work collaboratively as part of one of our multidisciplinary teams. You&rsquo;ll be contributing to ideation and decisions at all stages, actively shaping the design of everything you work on.

OPEN PTO POLICY

We respect work-life balance and recognize that flexibility is key. Coordinate within your team, keep up with your work, take time off when you need it. We don't restrict or limit the amount of time off team members take. 'Nuff&nbsp;said.

CHALLENGING WORK

Third Light is hiring a Back End Engineer &mdash;a Go developer or someone who has been mixing Go into their work or personal projects and is readynow looking for a primarily Go-based role.&nbsp;

You may work remotely - joining a team that already includes remote workers - or from our Cambridge office.

This is about delivering sophisticated new product features for release to our state-of-the-art software service that helps people manage and share their digital media files easily &ndash; features that deliver immediate positive impact for our global user base.&nbsp;

We're a small and expanding software development team, building an enterprise application with a highly-polished UI, using the very best and latest techniques. We employ an iterative, design-led process where everyone on the team gets a say.&nbsp;

Our product is a single-page JavaScript application loosely-coupled to a back end that's built on Go microservices and legacy PHP. We use microservices for all new features and Go is our chosen language to do this. In parallel we are migrating our older codebase to Go microservices.

We're agile and manage our work using a gentle Kanban process with daily stand-ups and we encourage a lightweight, productive approach to development. We can allocate projects that build upon your current strengths, and we offer a personal development approach that you may help shape.

Your opinion and expertise will be valued from day one. 



Upcoming projects within the team


* Integrate with social media to provide a publishing platform that can also gather user-generated content

* Provide AI and machine vision to detect duplicate files and provide auto-tagging and OCR

* Create a metrics &amp; reporting system to track usage of features, document downloads and image views

* Implement a full SFTP client &amp; server interface to integrate with SLR Cameras and legacy systems

* Extend workflow and automation microservices to create intuitive automated channel publishing tools

* Automate orchestration of microservices in our product e.g. exploring Kubernetes

* &lt; your idea here! &gt;





We're looking for


* Someone who's positive about Go and wishes to embrace this exciting language

* Proven back-end coding skills using either PHP or Go and for Linux

* Demonstrable interest in Go&mdash;from industry, self directed learning or personal projects

* An appreciation for continuous unit and integration testing

* Skills in designing, building, testing and maintaining web services, ideally microservices

* Ability to work with a large, live, production codebase

* Familiarity with relational databases e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL

* Familiarity with CI/CD, preferably within a Git-based workflow

* Optionally, familiarity with porting an OO monolith to a microservice architecture

* Someone considering mid level back-end jobs such as: Go Developer | Go Microservices Developer | Golang Developer| Node.js Developer | PHP Developer | Python Developer | Back End Engineer | Back End Developer etc.




You may bring&mdash;or like to gain&mdash;skills exploring any of the following


* Containers, containers as services and automated container deployment

* Large-scale storage, manipulation and streaming of multimedia

* Machine intelligence, visual recognition or similar numerical computation

* Production experience in systems configuration, monitoring, logging, and metrics gathering




Our current technology mix - we'll help you get up to speed

Go (aka Golang) | JavaScript | PHP | NGINX | MySQL | SockJS | RabbitMQ | Debian | macOS | VMware | Git | Jira | Bitbucket | Bamboo | Slack | Basecamp

Salary and benefits


* c.&pound;50,000&mdash; negotiable &mdash;we're keeping an open mind

* Contributory pension scheme

* Personal development plan that you can shape for related training/certifications/conferences

* 25 days holiday + public holidays | flexible hours | bicycle and free car parking | on site cafe | good coffee and tea | fresh fruit | choice of high end workstation | an adorable Beagle to brighten the office




Working remotely: The Third Light development team embraced remote working a few years ago and now has workers in more than one country. We strive to provide a friendly, fun, supportive remote-working culture and we refine our processes to make remoting easier. We will welcome your ideas and contributions. We provide computing equipment and cover reasonable costs incurred from running a home office.&nbsp;

Normally, as a new starter, you'd come to the office for a few weeks to get to know each other. Due to Coronavirus you will no-doubt join us remotely, at least temporarily, which will bring interesting challenges in how best to introduce you to, and integrate you into, the development team&mdash;how to train you, how to help familiarise yourself with our systems and ways of working. We see this as an interesting challenge so we&rsquo;re working it out at the moment. We're planning&nbsp;a fully-remote &lsquo;onboarding&rsquo; process with team meetups, one-to-one sessions and pair programming as well as online social gatherings for you when you join.&nbsp;

If you'd prefer to primarily work from our office this option will still be available to you after lockdown.

We've developed an online service which automates sales lead generation for B2B companies. Leadfeeder helps over 3000 paying customers to identify who visits their website, qualify the leads based on their behaviour, and convert the most promising visitors into sales leads.
Our 30+ strong in-house, all-remote engineering team is responsible for developing new features, and otherwise improving and maintaining the Leadfeeder product.
We are organised in feature-oriented, cross-functional squads. Each squad is responsible for specific features of the product, and works tightly together with high autonomy.

We believe in listening to everyone's ideas and feedback no matter what your role is, you get to have a say in the product and technical decisions of your squad.
Ruby on Rails developers at Leadfeeder work mainly on our backends: building APIs, background data processing flows, and integrations. Being a very data-intensive application, much of the work on the Leadfeeder backend involves optimising and effectively using various databases Cassandra, AWS RDS &amp; Aurora, Elasticsearch and Redis, to name a few.
Our backend, we run multiple small-to-medium-sized Ruby on Rails apps and use serverless components (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Kinesis) on the side. We pride ourselves on keeping apps working smoothly, and the codebase tidy and well-tested. We dedicate time for upgrades, refactoring and improvements in the developer experience.
For people with skills and interest, we offer possibilities to work on our Ember.js frontend too, enabling people to grow to a fullstack role. Equally, there are opportunities to learn and be involved in infrastructure, DevOps and serverless development.


Responsibilities
 * Developing new features together with your squad 
 * Build internal and public APIs
 * Build, benchmark and optimise our core backend components
 * Helping operate our production environments on AWS
 * Providing code reviews to your peers
 


Benefits

 * Get to work in a talented, remote-first international team
 * Chance to make an impact on a global product
 * Actual work-life balance with healthy 40-hour work weeks
 * Flexible work time
 * Biannual company retreats
 * Competitive salary
 * Friendly and encouraging work environment
 

Our hiring process:
After we've received and reviewed your application, there are a number of stages in our process: * Initial video call. You'll get to learn more about the role and our company, and we'll learn how you communicate and what are you looking for in the job.
 * Technical interview. Qualified candidates proceed to our technical interview, where we ask more in-depth technical questions.
 * Home assignment. We'll test your coding skills in building a small application. You can do this at home on your own time. The assignments usually take about 4-6 hours to complete.
 * Assignment review and skills interview. After our team has reviewed your assignment, we invite you to the next interview. We'll provide feedback and ask questions about your code. This interview also includes some pair-programming, where we do some improvements or additional features to your project.
 * Culture interview. The final step before decisions. Great cultural fit is highly important in our remote team. We also want to give you as much as possible information on how it is to work at Leadfeeder and what our culture is like.
 


All interviews are done remotely over video calls, but of course if you happen to be in the same city with some of our team members we're happy to organize a meeting on site.

About the Role

You will have the opportunity to own&nbsp;a variety of projects including our backend API (ruby), frontend dashboard (JavaScript), progress reporting architecture, server&nbsp;optimization for millions of requests a day, and&nbsp;everything else in-between. You&rsquo;ll work closely with every member of the Kodable team to make the greatest coding platform for kids even better.&nbsp;We&rsquo;re still a small-but-growing team, so you&rsquo;ll be asked to build large, high-traffic&nbsp;systems with little outside interference. No bureaucracy, just build it.

Who we&rsquo;re looking for:


* You have 5+ years web development experience in a production environment

* You have a deep, working knowledge of JavaScript (and have strong opinions on var vs let)

* You care deeply about programming education

* You have contributed significantly to the release of a production-level application (preferably not a side-project, something with actual users)

* You have experience with&nbsp;REST APIs from both client and server sides

* You have experience writing performant SQL queries and managing a high-traffic database&nbsp;(preferably&nbsp;PostgreSQL)




Highly Preferable if:


* You have experience with Ruby

* You have experience working with a front-end framework in a production environment (AngularJS, React, Vue, etc)

* You have experience with Test-Driven Development




Bonus Points for:


* Experience with Sinatra, Sequel, Grape, or ActiveRecord

* Experience with background jobs and asynchronous architecture (Sidekiq even better!)

* You've used JavaScript build systems such as Gulp

* You've worked with AWS Lambda and background jobs

* Game Development experience




About the team:

The Kodable team is full of bright, ambitious people who are passionate about their jobs. You&rsquo;ll work with a product team with over 50 years of collective experience creating top-notch games for companies like EA, Leapfrog, and Scientific Learning. Every member of the team has a voice in making Kodable great.

Right now, we&rsquo;re working on improving user experiences on both our parent and teacher dashboard. You&rsquo;ll join us in creating new features and improving existing ones to increase the value of Kodable to every parent, teacher and child who uses it.

And no, it&rsquo;s not that they studied more than the rest of us at school. There are a whole host of attributes that these people embody, which are never taught in school. Things like perseverance, passion, laser-like focus, a positive mindset, and the list goes on and on.

These classes are offered through our marketplace and conducted on our remote learning platform.

We're growing fast: over 250,000 learners have enrolled in classes, and we're doubling our team this year. We're an experienced team with past accomplishments at Airbnb, Square, Uber, Udemy, Amazon, Google, and many startups. We came together because we wanted to make a difference in education, and saw the opportunity to empower learners, teachers, and parents. Now we have a successful, fast-growing business and recently&nbsp;announced $8.5M Series A funding.

We are an effective team of senior engineers, getting a lot done by staying focused on the work that matters. We're iteratively building up a complex product for a highly engaged audience. Upcoming projects include data-driven recommendations, measuring teacher quality and learner engagement, learner profiles, integrated messaging, assignments, learning paths, growth experiments, better search, and more.

We work in modern JavaScript: React, GraphQL/Apollo, and Node/Express backed by PostgreSQL.

Here are some reasons to join us:


* Collaborative team culture that encourages pairing, iteration, and impact

* Novel vision to transform kids' education through remote teaching with live video chat

* Experienced team from Airbnb, Square, Amazon, Google, Udemy and Clever

* Lots of opportunities to make an impact by building large features end-to-end

* Consumer product with fast iteration cycles means you can have a big impact in a short time

* Proven, fast-growing marketplace business with millions of dollars in annual revenue

* Funded by top education and marketplace investors, Reach Capital and Union Square Ventures




We look for candidates who:


* Have been programming professionally and challenging themselves for at least 2 years

* Communicate clearly

* Balance big-picture perspective with attention to detail

* Take responsibility for their work

* Care about learning and education

* Have something to teach us

At Olo we develop an online food ordering platform used by many of the country's largest restaurant chains, reaching millions of consumers. Chances are if you've ordered directly from a restaurant brand's app or website, we've made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We're quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants' POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart! We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.

Olo is revolutionizing the customer experience with restaurant chains, and we're looking for talented engineers to join our team and help achieve this vision. As part of the team you will play a significant and visible role in helping us scale one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the market. You will design, develop, scale, and monitor solutions, improvements, and services in our core ordering platform. While primarily focused on our back-end, the position requires contributions throughout our stack. You'll work with a smart, passionate team dedicated to delivering amazing products using modern tools and technologies such as .NET Core,&nbsp;ASP.NET&nbsp;Core, TeamCity, GitHub, Octopus Deploy, and heavy use of OSS.

Any engineer may work at Olo's headquarters in New York City's Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team (and Olo) is remote!


What You&rsquo;ll Be Doing


* Handling small-to-medium features independently with some initial guidance.

* Demonstrating broad knowledge of software engineering concepts.

* Effectively using the basic tools of the trade, including source control, CI, unit test frameworks, and IDEs.

* Writing code that is high quality in order to get to a final, tested implementation.

* Understanding design trade-offs and making well-reasoned design decisions.

* Giving timely, helpful feedback to peers and managers.

* Consistently delivering against commitments.




What We&rsquo;ll Expect From You


* A passion for computing that extends beyond work

* At least 3 years of on-the-job development experience

* A drive to automate anything that has to be done more than once

* Proficient knowledge of C#, .NET and object-oriented concepts

* Experience writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)

* Strong understanding of Windows, database and networking concepts

* Experience instrumenting, deploying and monitoring production code&nbsp;

* Excellent English writing and communication skills

* Legal right to work in the U.S.




Beneficial


* B.S degree or equivalent education

* Experience developing for highly available and horizontally scalable SaaS platforms

* Experience with any of: Kafka, Redis, distributed messaging systems, Amazon Web Services, F#, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Terraform

* A background in restaurant or e-commerce technology, including point of sale systems, payment gateways, and CRM and loyalty platforms

What we do

Practichem, a Raleigh-based biotech firm focused on speeding antiviral cures to market, uses a patented protein chromatography instrumentation platform to deliver time and cost savings in the race to deliver critical viral health solutions worldwide.&nbsp;

Chromatography instrument technology lags well behind consumer tech. Many current scientific instruments are controlled by 1993-era software. When compared to current technology, chromatography instruments do not store and share data well. Studies reveal scientists spending the majority of their applied time extracting, converting, and loading data as part of their workflow. This is not a research science problem, or a chromatographic problem. This requires a software technology solution.

Practichem believes scientific instrument software should be as intuitive to use as a smart phone app. We&rsquo;re setting a new standard for the laboratory by creating browser based software that runs our scientific instruments. Help us drive innovation to the laboratory for greater discovery and collaboration.

Who we are

Practichem is a different kind of company and we like it that way. We have incredibly high standards and hire exceptional people who enjoy pushing themselves to perform at their highest levels every day. Join our team and enjoy an environment that appreciates hard work and achievements.&nbsp;

What we expect

You appreciate a start-up environment free from bureaucracy. You thrive on open discussion. You have incredibly high standards for documentation and testing procedures. Organization and consistency are standard operating procedures for you.

This must excite you. You must be curious and practical. You will be expected to challenge and be challenged, to create and innovate. Practichem's work style is not for everyone.&nbsp;

About SpiderOak

We want to change the world, and we&rsquo;ve already done it once. SpiderOak has been building encrypted software since before the first iPhone was released.

SpiderOak is committed to building secure and reliable software that protects our customers&rsquo; data. Our approach is fundamentally different from most mainstream security companies. Instead of adding layers of security on top of an insecure system, we build software that is inherently secure.

How are we different?

SpiderOak builds need-to-know technology that supports customers working in hostile environments. Traditional systems trust IT infrastructure to maintain the whole security system, even though the news is rife with evidence that this model does not work. Our software combines end to end encryption with a distributed ledger (aka Blockchain) technology to offer best-in-class security with no backdoors.

The Distributed Ledger, SpiderOak Model

A distributed ledger approach can provide compartmentalization of data that does not suffer from a single point of failure and is both fast and cost-effective. Compartments are defined using an irrefutable distributed ledger, enabling complete confidence in who is allowed to participate. Once the list of allowed users is defined, it becomes easy for those parties to negotiate shared encryption keys to secure the data being collaborated on.

Our approach allows for the instant provisioning of cryptographically secure collaboration spaces for use in scenarios where certainty about who has access to that space is a mission requirement.

About SpiderOak Engineering

Our Engineering team is comprised of passionate and creative people who are committed to the premise that complexity is the enemy of security. The problem of security will not be solved by layering on more band-aids, e.g. firewalls, packet inspection, two-factor authentication, etc... these actually add complexity by increasing the attack surface. We take a fundamentally different approach by removing the need to trust your infrastructure or your admins through the combination of


* Zero-trust systems and applied cryptography

* Distributed ledger




Our platform and applications &ndash; built on Go &ndash; enable our customers to collaborate and communicate securely, and we&rsquo;re looking for growing the team to help us turn this ambitious vision into reality. Our culture is focused on productivity and creativity, and we&rsquo;re committed to collaboration with our colleagues across the organization.

Job Description

Rather than bore you with a long description, let&rsquo;s cut to chase: your job is to create user interfaces using ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML and other front-end technologies. Integration examples currently include: networking, crypto, key store, file management, and push notifications&hellip; but the list might grow as the user needs evolve.

What We Do

We work with niche companies in the US, Canada, the UK&nbsp;to restructure and automate their operation so that their businesses can grow 5-10x. We do that by effectively analyzing their business, streamlining their processes, and designing an effective automation solution that we then implement on our robust IT stack.

We make extensive use of technologies that help us accomplish results with less work &mdash; making everyone inside of our global organization more effective.&nbsp;

We heavily leverage:&nbsp;


* 

Amazon AWS's serverless technologies and microservices for our front-end, back-end, and mobile apps (Lambda, Amplify, Cognito, S3, etc.).

Your ultimate&nbsp;deliverable will be to effectively build a solution that will be implemented in the client's business and run successfully going forward.

In doing so, you will:


* 

Design and architect complex solutions involving web apps (front+back), custom CRM/ERP's, programmable telephony, and occasionally mobile apps.


*

Experience with Amazon AWS, serverless technologies, and microservices on its platform.


* 

Experience with CRM and ERP systems such as Zoho and others.





What We Offer


* 

Results-Focused Approach to Work

There is base pay and project bonus pay. Base pay varies significantly by the Engineer's level of ability and responsibility (Lead/Associate/Assistant) that the Engineer takes on projects - this level is reassessed after every project that the Engineer completes. Projects upon completion are rewarded with a bonus - bonus depends on the delivery of all requirements assigned to the Engineer, timeliness of delivery, rate of errors, and the amount of management attention needed in the project. Engineers who can deliver functional solutions that match requirements quickly and with little management action to correct errors get the best rewards and promotions in the organization.


* 

Freely Arranged Schedule





You decide when you want to work. What we expect from you are results. There is a daily stand-up call &mdash; but outside of it, you can manage your schedule as you prefer.


* 

Work as an Engineer, Not Just a Coder
